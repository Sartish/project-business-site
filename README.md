# Business Site

Build a Business Site! 

This weekâ€™s project is to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or âœ…video header, a âœ…signup form, and âœ…an accordion. The focus is image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript.

## The built & challanges
This week was putting my HTML and CSS structure to a test as there was a lot of different content to be included that should fill also a function, like sign up form and accordion FAQ. 

- Styling the the page with CSS (Grid and flexbox)
- Site should have a header with responsive image/video
- Site should have a signup form with at least three different input types
- Site should have an FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript.
- Added different form elements or input types (radio buttons, drop down menu)
- Added + & - icon before the title in the accordion that indicates whether the section is expanded or collapsed. And it updates when the section expands or collapses.

ðŸ‘‰The Challange included styling the form, since it contained new HTML input types that should be aligned. further to make the hero image repsonsive. JS toggle was also a challange, since it was a new concept for me. To solve the issues included trail and error approach as well as searching answers  questions in  stack overflow and slack . 


ðŸ‘‰NEXT is adding more JS functionality to the page, such as when one section is expanded in the accordion the others collapse and re-use only use one function in stead of different once for each questions. Also to add labels for accessability.
